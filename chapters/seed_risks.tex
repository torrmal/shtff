\markboth{EXECUTION RISK}{EXECUTION RISK [WIP]}


Oh, sweet Buddha, there's a glorious next level in this video game of venture-backed startups—the "seed round." To claw your way into this next dimension, you must master execution risk. To understand this, imagine yourself blindfolded, juggling fire while riding a unicycle across a tightrope. A panel of VCs below, scoring your performance like Olympic judges who’ve just snorted lines of exponential growth. That’s what it feels like: you’re expected to fundraise and build at the same time, which requires the focus of a kamasutra monk and the risk appetite of a wingsuit pilot. Forget what your probability professor told you—here, in this game, you often have the odds against you.

\section*{The Seed End State}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{The Seed End State}

To get into the details of execution risk in particular, let's start with the end state and walk backwards from there; You will find yourself crossing the seed stage portal: You've actually convinced a room full of Patagonia-wearing venture capitalists that your business isn't just another ayahuasca vision. You all agree on the value they see in your company! and the term-sheet is still warm from signatures to an investment in amounts of tens of millions, enough zeros to make you question if you are dreaming, economics professors rock back and forth in padded rooms, clutching equations and whimpering about fundamentals like abandoned lovers at a wedding.

If everything is executed with excellence, you will soon after, hear a notification on your phone from your corporate bank account and, you will know the seed round money made it in. Suddenly, high on hopes like it's your last day at Burning Man, you're strutting around like a peacock who just discovered Instagram filters - we're talking premium Cup Noodles with actual dehydrated vegetables, baby! I know, I know - contain your bourgeois gasps. Because, before we continue deeper into this champagne-and-instant-ramen lifestyle, let's as promised, rewind and examine how one ascends from the primordial soup of pre-seed stage to this slightly less primordial soup of seed funding. Welcome to the small-big leagues tryouts, habibi. I hope you brought a good therapist.

\section*{The Pre-seed to Seed Stage Metamorphosis}

Before you are seed stage ready, your life should feel like all of a sudden your story starts to click, you starting to see those pre-seed checks roll in like they're auditioning for a financial strip show. There you are, swimming in the primordial soup of Angel money like a startup amoeba with delusions of grandeur, and soon after, you will feel like you have mastered the problem you are here to kill, your market makes sense to everyone that hears you talk about it, and, you no longer see any founder risks, so you start piling up those SAFEs like a squirrel hoarding nuts for nuclear winter. Total amount raised?, creeping up on that various mill territory. Those weeks or months of pitching felt like trying to explain string theory to your chihuahua. But now, you have cracked the code, right? right?

\subsection*{The Physics of This Game}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{The Physics of This Game}
Well, hold onto your ergonomic standing desk!, because if you are not really careful, money's about to pull a Houdini faster than you can say "burn rate." Be WARNED about the physics of this game: you are flying an airplane with a hole in the gas tank.

\subsection*{What do you need to Execute?}

You need to be able to focus, so yes, finally pay yourself just enough to make your darling Banka'f'merica stop sending you those passive-aggressive overdraft love letters. And get very tactical about what you need to execute.

\subsubsection*{Hire the Minimum Number of People You Need}

If your wallet can afford it, and if you must, hire for very, very critical gaps, but please don't. Just... don't, do not go wild. Every person you add to your startup smoothie is like adding another flavor - sounds great until you're drinking a kale-pineapple-blockchain-AI monstrosity that tastes like broken dreams. Before you know it, your nimble little startup is moving with all the grace and speed of a three-toed sloth. Trust me, you want to avoid being slow at all costs.

\subsubsection*{Runway and Burn-Rate}
In the previous glossary we introduced our stooge couple: Runway and Burn-Rate. They are your best friends. If you are not careful and with the minimum number of people you need before Product Market Fit: your company's checking account will become the antimatter to your progress, a cosmic black hole devouring resources faster than a Silicon Valley juice cleanse destroys wallets. Time warps like a Dali painting on acid, and the next thing you know, your product is as visible as a ninja at midnight wearing active camouflage. Meanwhile, you're lying awake at 3 AM, staring at the ceiling like it's displaying error messages from the Matrix, mentally rehearsing how to ask your best friend - who abandoned a cushy corporate job to join your circus - if she misses free snacks and dental insurance. 

As such, listen up, you beautiful disaster: transitioning from pre-seed to seed stage is NOT how good you are at getting seed money, that talks more about your poetry skills. It is about your metamorphosis from powerpoint slides to a tangible solution or MVP. Where you can validate that people really want a solution for the problem you are solving, while at the sametime you are also building the solution and burning cash, which is like being in a reality show where the prize is more borrowed time.  Because, every time you accept money, you are inviting people to your unicorn ride. Eventually, everyone who drank your Kool-Aid of disruption, they're all going to emerge from their WeWork meditation pods and demand to see some cold, hard results. And you, yes YOU, you magnificent delusional optimist, you'll MUST be the one leading that results-demanding parade. Remember, amigo: you started this dream and you should be chasing that dream like an overenthusiastic puppy interacting with senile dogs at the park, sniffing butts, trees, rocks, running around like a maniac until someone decides to play catch with you and your ball. Execution has become your new religion. 

So while you're celebrating those pre-seed wins (as you probably modestly, very modestly should), remember that the clock is ticking. Your job now is also to make sure your product is used. Execute. Validate. Iterate. Repeat.  And the brutal truth: The best product in the world is worth exactly zero if nobody uses it. You could build the digital equivalent of sliced bread, but if you can't get it in front of people who actually need to make sandwiches, you're just creating very expensive nothing.
