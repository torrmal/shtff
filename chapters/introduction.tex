If you have it in you. Whatever that is, there's something seductive about the Bay Area, something that draws you in like a moth to a flickering light. But behind that glittering surface, there's a dark swirl of uncertainty, where even the boldest ideas can live in constant superposition of death and alive. That is what this book is about. Not the glossy headlines or the Silicon Valley mythology, but the real pains: the blood, the sweat, and the game of hidden rules I wish we had known about before diving headfirst into the madness of being a founder looking for funding.

\subsection*{Why this book?}
Let me briefly introduce myself and explain why I wrote this book. I'm JT, CEO of MindsDB, a company I co-founded with my dear friend Adam C. In the end of 2023, we raised a \$47M seed round from some of the best investors in the world. How did we, the chihuahuas in a pitbull fight, managed to do that?—that's the question I get from many early-stage founders or aspiring founders. Now, depending on the circles you run in, \$47M might be seen as either a drop in the ocean or a staggering amount of cash. But, in most circles, that's a pretty decent seed round.

For us, it didn't come easy, and it sure as hell didn't happen overnight. Before that seed round, we had gone through a wild journey of raising about \$8 million in pre-seed money, and so much could have been done differently. So, a year ago, as a way to blow off steam, I decided to write 3-4 pages every weekend to send to those who ever so often come to me and asking fundraising questions and like us—plucky little scamps—are walking that early startup journey and need funding to make it happen.

What matters here isn't just how much we raised, but the brutal learning curve it took to get there—the fuckups, the close calls, the lessons they don't teach you in any classroom or startup accelerator. And trust me, we've had our share of those. There are great books on the business principles needed to get from nothing to "scale up" (and please, read them). These tales are only from the fundraising perspective. We learned that no one gives you the real picture for surviving the actual sh*t and the unspoken rules that can make or break your first big round. Almost no-one tells you how it feels to walk out of a dead-end meeting with a prospective investor, licking the bruises and gashes of a pitch that went nowhere, questioning if you're pushing forward with genius or just a dumb idea that's about to implode.

\subsection*{Who is this book for?}

Specifically, this book is for you if you're somewhere between "I have an idea, this idea needs some moolah to get it off the ground" and "I am just working on a seed round that would make grandma faint." The focus here is just the fundraising part, what is covered in this book is just but one part of a long journey of building a company.

This book is for the dreamers who've decided that working for someone else's dream is about as riveting as watching someone else's loading bar reach 99\%. In particular, I wrote this for the underdogs. The ones who don't have a Stanford MBA, a family trust fund, or a cousin who's best friends with Marc Andreessen's barber. 

You? you could be anyone, but, If I could take a wild guess you are one of the following:

\subsubsection*{You're are fresh out of college or before that}
Congratulations, you still get carded at the bar and your liver is younger than most houseplants.
Still clueless after graduation? Welcome to the club of many! If you have no idea what to do with your life, join a startup that’s tackling a problem so big it makes your parents question your sanity. Worst case, you’ll learn what not to do. Best case, you’ll accidentally stumble into your life’s work while eating ramen at 2am with people who also have no idea what they’re doing. Either way, it beats living in your mom’s basement explaining to her why your crypto portfolio is “just consolidating.”

You are that person that has found a problem, has prototyped a solution during your free time and no matter what you do, for as ugly as your solution is, the problem is so insane that people keep asking you for it? Well, you are in the right place, but you will not need this book for too long. You are as rare as a monkey riding a Segway through a Taco Bell drive-thru at 3am, investors will chase you. Enjoy your brief stay here, you beautiful anomaly.

\subsubsection*{You're still working that cushy corporate gig}
There's a greater than zero chance that you're still working that cushy corporate gig, the one with the nice benefits, the reliable paycheck, the reassuring stability of a 401k that seems to stretch out into your comfortable retirement. You're good at navigating the slow, bureaucratic machinery of the corporate world, learning to squeeze the teats of some incredible product-market fit that someone else created years ago. And let's face it—you've gotten pretty damn good at milking it, haven't you? But every once in a while, something inside you stirs. Something tells you that maybe—just maybe—you're wasting your life. Maybe you're like I was, sitting in those endless meetings thinking, "What would happen if I just said, 'fuck it' and did my own thing?"

If you and I are made of the same, that itch doesn't go away. I believe, It is very likely that one day, too old to hold your farts, while reflecting on the reflection of your saggy butt cheeks in the mirror, you'll look back at your safe life, your stack of savings, your perfectly planned but shrinking future, and you'll ask yourself between the tortures of I wonder what woulds: What would have happened if I asked for that phone number,... what might have been if I'd just taken the leap,... what did I miss?. 

You have mouths to feed? buckle up honey, you are in for a fucking scary ride.

\subsubsection*{You're already a founder}
Maybe, naive enough, you've already made that leap, and… you're here because you're drowning or like a confused pinguin desperatly flapping its wings trying to fly before it hits the ground. Trust me, I know how it feels. One day, you're walking on water, feeling like you've cracked the code, like the world is suddenly obvious. And the next, you're gasping for air, trying to claw your way out from under an iceberg that's crushing you. Welcome to the rodeo cowgirls and cowboys. You've chosen this life, and hopefully this book helps you f'it up a bit less.
