\chapter{The Two Risks Theory: Your Pree-seed Startup figures it’s basic sh*t out or dies}
\markboth{THE TWO RISKS THEORY}{THE TWO RISKS THEORY}

Early-Stage Funding isn't just about money. It's about the psychology of parting ways with money to someone that is mostly a stranger, about understanding the beautiful madness that makes someone look at your half-baked idea and think, "Yes, I would like to set some perfectly good money on fire in the hopes that this particular flame might turn into a phoenix." Before you can dance this particular tango, you need to know that in the end, this whole game is about: risk, wearing different hats, speaking different languages, but always risk, specifically for investors, they're measuring the density of uncertainty that your startup will survive from the moment they give you money to that imaginary moment in the future of 5-10 years when they will be able to get them dollars back times many.

Picture risk as a quantum field that warps and shifts depending on where you stand in the startup timeline. Like those Buddhist texts that describe different realms of existence—the hell realms (suffering and despair -> pre-seed), the hungry ghost realms (insatiable thrust and hunger -> seed), the human realm (balance between joy and pain -> post-seed)—each stage of funding occupies its own distinct reality tunnel, complete with its own physics, complexities, challenges and metaphysics of risk. In the pages ahead, we'll navigate through two of these parallel dimensions: the pre-seed funding realm, where ideas float like unanchored dreams in a sea of pure possibility but you are also hit with a dose of confusion, suffering and despair, and the seed funding realm, where those dreams begin to crystallize into something that might actually survive contact with reality. Each realm demands its own rituals of understanding, its own sacrifices, its own strange dances with uncertainty. To traverse them successfully, grab your notepads, my sweet summer platypuses, you'll need to become fluent in their respective languages of risk—because while they might look similar from a distance, up close they're different.

There is something I've witnessed so many times; it's started to feel like one of those immutable truths—like the way cats always land on their feet or how your code only works perfectly right before the demo crashes. In the pre-seed stage, there are really only two fundamental risks that matter: market risk and founder risk. They dance together like drunk philosophers at a Silicon Valley meditation retreat. You must learn to master those risks if you ever want to get past the starting line of your startup, and yes this is also a critical requirement for any funding in your plans. As these are basically the two only reasons why everyone (but you) knows that you can certainty die from. Once again: If you are not aware of these risks, you are most likely to be the next startup that no one will ever hear about. 

\subsection*{Our first exposure to risk awareness}

As a proxy for explaining the market and founder risks in this chapter, let me tell you about my first contact with an investor ever, and illustrate how simple the thought process for investors is. This was only a few days into my previous startup, the one that failed, our dear friend Rob, who joined us as a co-founder storms into the room like he'd just seen Elvis riding an alpaca through the parking lot. "You guys know who Mark Cuban is?" he gasped, practically vibrating with excitement.

We were so clueless about anything startups, that frankly, I looked at him confused, mentally flipping through my limited sports Rolodex like a drunk trying to find their house key.

"He's the guy from Shark Tank," Rob explained, probably questioning all his life choices that led to this moment. “Mark, saw our startup and has three questions”: "Hi guys! Tell me about the market, what’s your plan to get that market, and why are you doing this?."

So we did what any new “founder” should never ever do (to any investor, or anyone interested in your gig): We wrote a four-page UN style essay that read like a love letter crossed with a business plan and seasoned with just a hint of desperation. We even invited Cuban to dinner, because apparently, we thought TV celebrities are just sitting around waiting for dinner invites from random startup kids that just flew in from the other side of the world. But then again, what if he had said yes? 


As I write this, and think about that moment, I doubt Cuban made it past "Dear Mr. Cuban, must we start with we love your show about sharks… (see my underwear attached)" before his eyes glazed over and he filed our email under "fucking clueless." We had no idea we were playing a game with rules that everyone pretty much understand, we were playing chess while still trying to figure what tic-tac-toe is. Now I know, and I hope you learn that all Cuban wanted to know was how risky our venture was. That's it. Very simple questions that we answered with what was essentially "100 years of solitude draft 2".

So let me break it down to you.


\section{Market Risk: What percentage of the net global economy are we talking about?}

Market risk is like that friend who keeps telling you they'll definitely come to your party but never shows up. It's the risk that even if you build exactly what you set out to build, even if you execute flawlessly, the market might just ghost you like a bad Hinge date. This is the risk that should be keeping you early stage founder awake at 3 AM, staring at the ceiling until you are convinced that the market you are going after is enourmous.
Think of it this way: An overused, but always useful analogy is that you could build the world's most perfect horse-drawn carriage in 1910, with exquisite craftsmanship and revolutionary  boudoir features, but Henry Ford's Model T was already making your entire market obsolete. That amigos, that is market risk. It's like opening a blockbuster video store in 2007—technically perfect execution of an idea whose time had passed, or like trying to sell life insurance to vampires, solving a problem for people that don't have that problem.
The tricky thing about market risk is that it disguises itself as technical risk, like a programmer who shows up to a party wearing a "Trust me, I'm a people person" t-shirt while clutching their laptop like a security blanket. Most startup literature, written by people who probably haven't written code since BASIC was cool, will solemnly tell you: Technical founders are like cats chasing laser pointers when it comes to engineering challenges, frantically pouncing on every shiny technical problem while the actual business opportunity casually strolls out the door. They'll (We'll - maybe?) spend months perfecting their distributed quantum blockchain AI architecture while their potential customers are busy not giving a shit. Here's one brutal truth served with a side of reality sauce: startups don't die because their tech stack wasn't perfect. They die because they built something as useful as a submarine with a sunroof. You may already know all that, internet is full of it, however, there is more…
Let me tell you something that nobody told me early on, probably because they were too busy drawing startup journey diagrams that look like rollercoasters designed by a drunk architect. It’s not about the idea, it’s about the problem. Before you even think about writing code or making those PowerPoint slides, you need to become something of a professional creeper. Not the weird kind, the kind that observes real problems that real people have. And when I say real people, in some cases, the kind that wouldn't know a REST API from a nap. You need to find problems that affect so many people that even your grandmother's bridge club is complaining about them. Then ask yourself: is this actually a problem, or am I just a hammer looking for nails? And here's the kicker, would you be happy spending the next decade of your life solving this problem? Because let's be real, somebody had to invent toilet paper, and that person probably didn't wake up one morning thinking "Today, I'm going to revolutionize the ass-wiping industry!" But thank god they did, because alternatives were... suboptimal. So before you dive into building the next big thing, make sure it's a problem worth solving, this is critical while your savings account slowly dies of loneliness.
Here's a rule of thumb \#1 that's as reliable as gravity and twice as painful to ignore: if you can't multiply the number of potential customers by the price they'd actually pay (not your fantasy number, the real one that makes them wince but still nod) and get to at least a billion dollars, you're deep in founder risk territory. It'll shine through your pitch like a disco ball at a funeral, catching every investor's eye for all the wrong reasons. You might as well be wearing a t-shirt that says "I haven't done my homework" in neon letters while trying to convince Warren Buffett to invest in your artisanal pickle startup.
Think about it, if your total addressable market calculation looks more like a corner store's daily receipts than a small nation's GDP, you're not just facing an uphill battle; you're trying to climb Mount Everest in flip-flops while carrying a refrigerator. And trust me, those check-writing veterans, those grizzled veterans of a thousand pitches, they can smell this particular flavor of delusion from three accelerator programs away. It's like trying to hide an elephant in a phone booth technically possible if you have a really big phone booth and a really small elephant, but who are you really fooling?
And here's the thing, this market risk versus founder risk duality isn't just some abstract concept I'm tossing at you like Confucius wrapped in a fortune cookie's existential crisis. Trust me, this particular flavor of metaphysical torment will become your most faithful companion, more constant than your shadow, more persistent than that one bug in production that only appears during demos. The veterans of this strange game, those battle-scarred prophets of the Valley, they'll tell you with knowing smiles that it never really leaves: it's like a philosophical tattoo you got while completely lucid, fully aware it would become a permanent part of your consciousness, like the awareness of your own mortality.
Years from now, when you're deep in the trenches of startup life, feeling like you're simultaneously trying to explain general relativity to a goldfish while performing brain surgery on yourself in a moving elevator that's also on fire, you'll look back at these early days of fretting about market risk versus founder risk and laugh. Not because it gets easier, oh sweet innocent child of summer, but because you'll have developed the kind of cosmic humor that comes from watching reality repeatedly transform your meticulously crafted plans into abstract performance art, like watching a Picasso painting happen to your business model in real-time. And you don’t want to tell yourself, I wholesomely messed up the first step of this journey… Market risk.
So after finding a problem that plagues the masses like a particularly persistent existential itch, remember and repeat Rule of thumb 2.1 from the previous chapter: You must fall in love with it more deeply than any priest has ever loved their calling; we're talking about the kind of devotion that makes religious zealots look like casual Sunday churchgoers. Or so it begins: Founder risk.


\section{Founder Risk: The Human Comedy}

Imagine trying to predict which way a cat will jump while it's still thinking about it. This is the risk that the founding team might implode, pivot into oblivion, or simply lack the adaptability to navigate the chaos of early-stage company building. It's often less about technical capability and more about that ineffable quality of being able to dance on hot coals while juggling flaming swords and singing "Like a prayer", backwards.

I've seen brilliant technical founders who could architect complex systems in their sleep but crumbled faster than a cookie in a milk tsunami when faced with actual human interaction. I've seen charismatic visionaries who could sell premium sand in the Sahara but couldn't execute their way out of a paper bag. Founder risk is about the gap between what a team thinks they can do and what they can actually deliver when everything is on fire and Mercury is perpetually in retrograde.

Let me paint you a picture that's as common in Silicon Valley as electric scooters and overpriced smoothie bowls: Two bright-eyed founders, fresh from that magical OpenAI pizza mixer, convinced they're the next Jobs-Wozniak duo because they both like apples and finished each other's sentences about Musk. Fast forward three months, and they're having the kind of relationship discussions that make divorce court look like a tea party. There are learnings on what possible scenarios you are to live, covered in Chapter 6. But, the learning for you here is how you understand that a dance between these two risks is mastered.


Here's the unvarnished truth, served with a side of reality check: Your co-founder relationship needs more careful consideration than your last five Bumble matches combined. And let's be honest, at least on Bumble, the worst that can happen is an awkward coffee date. With a co-founder, you're signing up for a business marriage that makes actual marriage look like a casual fling. You're not just sharing dreams and equity; you're sharing the kind of stress that makes your hair turn gray while you're reading this sentence.

If you're still in that honeymoon phase where everything feels like a rom-com directed by the universe itself, where you and your co-founder feel like you're sharing one cosmic brain cell, well... Lets cover  the rifts that every startup blog, Medium article, and TechCrunch think piece loves to dissect like they're performing an autopsy on a failed relationship while trying to sell you a course on "founder harmony." These are the classics, the greatest hits of startup dysfunction, the relationship problems that make marriage counselors look at founder therapy and say "nah, I'm good." But unlike those sanitized listicles written by people whose biggest venture was a lemonade stand, I'm going to give you what I have seen to be true.

\subsection{The "I'm Not Your Employee" Tango}
Picture this: One founder, usually the CEO type who's watched one too many Steve Jobs documentaries and thinks wearing the same hoodie every day makes them a visionary, starts treating their co-founder like they're an entry-level code monkey who just learned what a for-loop is. Suddenly, every conversation feels like a performance review, and the other founder is composing passive-aggressive Slack messages that would make Shakespeare sweat with their subtle brutality. It's like watching a marriage dissolve because one person decided they're the "parent" and the other is the "child" who needs to be told to clean their room – except the room is a Git repository and the cleaning is a complete architecture overhaul at 11 PM on a Sunday.

\subsubsection*{How people tell you to avoid it?} They set up elaborate "feedback frameworks" and "communication protocols" that last exactly 2.5 days before devolving into passive-aggressive emoji reactions and cryptic "we need to talk" calendar invites. Some try rotating CEO roles weekly, which works about as well as letting two toddlers take turns being in charge of naptime. 

\subsubsection*{The real solution?} Let me tell you about the ancient startup ritual of Ego Death By Whiskey™. You and your co-founder, armed with the cheapest bottle of liquid courage Walgreens had to offer, engaging in what I call "preventive therapy for the cosmically doomed." Because here's the thing about co-founder relationships; they're like playing Russian roulette. You'll face these moments where reality starts bending, where suddenly your co-founder's face morphs into that of every bad decision you've ever made. And that's when you realize: holy shit, this is exactly like that time you thought dating that scary someone but then senses came back to you. If these red flags start waving harder than a bored semaphore operator after their double espresso, and no amount of "let's align our chakras" talks can fix it, well... Remember how you Matrix-dodged that toxic ex? Yeah, time to channel that energy again. For the nth time in this book: Life is short.

\subsection{The Great Equity Regret Spiral}
Oh, the sweet agony of realizing you split the equity 50/50 because you were both high on startup dreams and matching friendship bracelets! Three months in, one founder is pulling 20-hour days while the other is "building relationships" by attending every startup mixer in a 50-mile radius and posting LinkedIn updates about "the grind" with more hashtags than actual content. The technical founder is sleeping under their desk, debugging production issues, while the business founder is "ideating" over \$14 smoothie bowls with other "visionaries." Shitless scared of their part of the job, avoiding fundraising and customer rejection like that guy who only sends LinkedIn connection requests through a VPN in Antarctica, so when no one accepts, he can blame it on the penguins.. Suddenly, those equity conversations you had over beers and optimism feel like they were negotiated by your most naive past self, who clearly needed a stern talking-to about the value of actual work versus "vibes management."

\subsubsection*{How you are going to handle this?}  Results, baby!! Smart founders try to implement vesting cliffs and milestone-based equity distribution. The really smart ones? They also, actually talk about expectations before splitting equity like it's the last slice of pizza at 3 AM. 

\subsubsection*{How Less smart founders handle it?} Just passive-aggressively track each other's working hours in a spreadsheet that will definitely never be used as evidence in a future lawsuit. 

\subsection{The Technical-vs-Business Thunderdome}
Two founders enter, no founder leaves without emotional scarring! In one corner, we have the technical founder who believes business development is just fancy talk for "lunch meetings" and considers PowerPoint a form of fiction. In the other, we have the business founder who thinks debugging is something you do with a fly swatter and believes "just add blockchain" is a valid technical specification. They circle each other like wary cats, each convinced the other's job is basically a hobby. The technical founder mutters about "actually building something" while the business founder waves them term sheet templates like they're magic scrolls of legitimacy. It's like watching two people try to build a bridge from opposite sides of a canyon, except one's using mathematics and the other's using PowerPoint animations.

\subsubsection*{Prevention attempts (That you should avoid)?} Some try job shadowing, which usually ends with the business founder breaking production and the technical founder accidentally insulting a key investor. Others try weekly "education sessions" that quickly devolve into "explain it like I'm five" moments that leave both parties questioning their life choices. 

\subsubsection*{The rare success stories?} As obvious as it reads: They learn to appreciate that both skills are necessary, sadly however, this only usually happens after a near-death experience involving a failed demo and a very angry investor. We will cover more on this throughout this book.

\subsection{The Vision Schism}
Remember that perfect alignment you had about changing the world through blockchain-enabled sustainable coffee sourcing for introverted dolphins? Well, surprise! One founder now thinks you should pivot to AI-powered meditation apps for pest control, while the other is still committed to the original vision like it's their firstborn child. You're no longer finishing each other's sentences – you're interrupting them with "actually..." and "well, technically..." until your all-hands meetings (it's just you two) feel like philosophical cage matches moderated by your increasingly concerned whiteboard.

\subsubsection*{How some blogs tell you to cope?} Some founders create elaborate "vision documents" that become longer than Game of Thrones fan fiction. Others implement strict "pivot protocols" that require three rounds of committee approval – in a company of three people. The ones that nail founders risk? They learn to embrace the chaos and treat their vision like a living document, not a religious text. 

\subsubsection*{You?} Unless you're Moses and your startup plan literally descended from heaven on stone tablets (in which case, kudos on the divine MVP), you're going to have to embrace the art of being wrong. Like, spectacularly wrong. The kind of wrong that makes your past self want to travel through time just to give you a gentle slap and a "bless your heart." Every day is basically a cosmic comedy where the universe looks at your carefully crafted plans and says "That's cute, hold my beer."
Here's the thing about startup visions - You need to roll with the punches, pivot faster than a black swan ballerina, and accept that absolute truths in startups are about as real as your investor's promises to "definitely" make those follow-up intros.
And for the love of all things holy, while you and your co-founder are having your fifteenth philosophical throwdown about whether the button should be "seafoam green" or "mint whisper," remember this: in the time you've spent arguing, you could have A/B tested both options, discovered they both suck, and pivoted to interpretive dance software. The truth usually lies somewhere in the middle, probably hanging out with all your discarded product features and that one sock that always disappears in the laundry.

\subsection{The Money Honey Meltdown}
This one's a classic: One founder wants to bootstrap until the heat death of the universe, eating nothing but expired ramen and coding by candlelight to save on electricity. The other is ready to raise a Series A before the MVP has even MVP'd, dreaming of office ping pong tables and kombucha on tap while planning the company retreat to Bali for "team building." Every financial decision becomes a proxy war for deeper values, like watching two people try to plan a wedding where one wants a backyard BBQ and the other wants to rent the International Space Station. The phrase "burn rate" gets thrown around like a weapon, and the company credit card becomes a source of more drama than all seasons of Silicon Valley combined.

\subsubsection*{The prevention playbook on Medium?} Some try setting up elaborate budgeting systems that would make an accountant cry tears of joy, only to ignore them completely when the first shiny SaaS tool catches their eye. Others create detailed financial plans that become obsolete faster than a cryptocurrency whitepaper. 

\subsubsection*{The ones who make it?} They learn to balance frugality with function, usually after a few close calls with bankruptcy.

\subsection*{So, what is the lesson here?}

These rifts, my friends, are as inevitable as technical debt and as common as "disruptive" startups in San Francisco. They lurk beneath the surface of every co-founder relationship like psychological landmines wrapped in term sheets and equity agreements, waiting to explode. But here's the real trick: surviving these rifts is what separates the unicorns from the "whatever happened to that startup". So embrace the learning from chaos, keep your therapist on speed dial if you have one, and remember:  if you're going through founder hell, keep going, just remember to pack your sense of humor because that is as much as you can afford, you know that equity lawyer who charges more per hour than a therapist specializing in venture capitalist daddy issues and will not fix the core issues. It's like that old saying: what doesn't kill your startup makes it stronger, or at least makes for a better story at your next founder support group meeting.

Look, until you've wrestled these demons into submission, you're basically walking around with a flashing neon sign that screams "FOUNDER RISK" in Comic Sans. And those savvy investors? They can smell that fear from three WeWork locations away, like sharks detecting a single drop of imposter syndrome in an ocean of startups.

Founder risk is fatal, you precious disaster-in-waiting: if you've got a co-founder (and survived reading those previous tales of startup horror), I'm about to drop some truth that'll save your sanity faster than a shot of vodka saves a bad first date. Before you even THINK about incorporating, be cautious of that one who claims to be a startup guru because he once met Mark Z's barber's dog walker, and figure out who's wearing which hat in this circus.
Now, I know what you're thinking: "But we're a dynamic trio! We're like Batman, Robin and that guy that is always working, except we all think we're Batman!" That whole "everyone does everything" approach sounds as dreamy as a unicorn riding a rainbow while singing Queen's greatest hits. In theory, it's beautiful: like communism or those "healthy" cookies that taste like sweetened cardboard with chocolate-adjacent chips. But in practice? It's about as functional as a glass hammer at a construction site.

Want to move at the speed of light (or at least faster than your competitors who are still debating their logo font)? You need roles clearer than your ex's hints that "it's not you, it's me." And for the love of all things profitable, either have decisions in od numbers (3, 5max), or get as fast as possible to the point wehre you agree who can make the final call when in doubt, when it's 3 AM and you're both staring at each other like two squirrels trying to remember where they buried their last acorn, paralyzed by the earth-shattering decision of whether to print business cards or just exist in the digital ether.

Here's a brutal litmus test that'll save you years of therapy: If you look at your co-founder's skills in their domain and you don't feel like a toddler with crayons trying to reproduce the Mona Lisa, you're probably in for the kind of trouble that makes the Titanic look like a minor boating incident. You should be in awe of each other's capabilities like a cat watching a ceiling fan – completely mesmerized and slightly confused about how they do that thing they do. If you're both Python developers who think product management is just writing longer commit messages, you're not a founding team; you're a coding club with delusions of grandeur.

The real trouble? and oh boy, is it trouble – comes when you realize too late that you're basically dating your clone. It's like trying to start a restaurant where everyone's a chef and nobody wants to wash the dishes. Because once again; you need someone who makes you feel like an absolute amateur in their domain, and vice versa. Because when the shit hits the fan (and in startups, there's always a fan, and it's always on max speed), you need to trust that your co-founder has got their domain locked down tighter than a drum while you handle your own circus, otherwise wicked stuff will happen, and that flavour of trouble doesn't just knock: it kicks down the door, raids your fridge, and decides to crash on your couch indefinitely while eating all your premium ramen stash.



\section*{The Cosmic Dance}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{The Cosmic Dance}

Here's where it gets interesting: these two risks are like conjoined twins who took different life paths, with one becoming more dominant than the other. In my opinion, you should address the essentials of founder risk first, so you can focus on market risk while keeping founder risk under control. As such, everything about founder risk should be handled efficiently. On the one hand; If you spend too much time perfecting your team dynamics through ayahuasca ceremonies, the market might move on without you. On the other hand; Everything about market risk is an ongoing discovery proccess, perhaps only until you start building product and pitching you start seeing market gaps you didn't want to see before.


Here’s your pre-seed vibe check: if every meeting is a rerun of “So, Who’s the CEO?” or “Are you sure you’re not just dressed up as a startup on Halloween?”—congrats, you’re still radiating founder risk like a Chernobyl reactor. But if the questions suddenly mutate into “Show me your month-over-month growth, your CAC, your LTV, your secret handshake with the market gods,” and you’re sweating because you have more metrics in your ass than dollars in your bank account, that’s not a bad thing—it means you’ve finally convinced people you’re a real team and now they want to know if this market even makes sense at all, and, only you get to find the answer to that. This also means your market story still probably sucks, so you need to work on that. 

As you build some pitching scar tissue, you will also learn that different investors will weigh these risks differently based on their own trauma— I mean, experiences. But you, you need to believe you've got those two risks covered, when you really believe that, not the shallow belief of a startup founder practicing their pitch in front of a mirror, but the deep cosmic certainty that comes from staring into the void until the void starts taking notes. Everything in your pre-seed daays will start to happen, the investors will materialize before you; like Buddha-nature revealing itself to an enlightened monk.

Understanding these two risks is crucial because it shapes everything about how you understand your business and therefore how you approach the pre-seed stage. And when it comes to investors: It influences who you pitch to, how you pitch, and what kind of validation you prioritize. It's about recognizing that at this stage, you're not just building a product or a company—you're conducting an elaborate performance art piece where the audience decides if your credit card banks will ask you to "get on your knees and call me daddy" next month.

So when you're out there raising pre-seed money, remember: you're not just selling a vision or a product. You're selling your understanding of these two risks and your strategy for navigating market risk precisely (founder risk coverage is not optional, it can't be a plan, you must show it practically doesn't exist). The investors who get it, who really understand this strange dance, they're not looking for certainty, they know that sh*t is not found in nature; they're looking for founders who can tap dance through a minefield while making it look like performance art.
