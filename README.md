A book for people who Googled "how to raise money" at 3 AM and ended up here instead of therapy.

This is a draft of my learnings of the pre-seed stage funding at [mindsdb](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb)

## What Is This?

A survival guide disguised as a founders tutorial to fundraising.

If you've ever:
- Explained your startup to your mom and watched her soul leave her body
- Split equity 50/50 because "the vibes felt right"
- Called a pivot a "strategic evolution" with a straight face
- Mass emailed VCs like you were launching a desperate OnlyFans for term sheets

Welcome home.

## Build the Book

```bash
make book
```

That's it. Your PDF appears like a VC at a YC lunch: `book.pdf`

## Requirements

LaTeX. Install it however you install things. You're a founder; you'll figure it out or mass blame it on your co-founder.

## Who Should Read This?

Founders. Dreamers. People whose therapists have therapists.

Anyone who's ever looked at their bank account, then at their burn rate, and whispered: *"Math is just, like, a vibe."*

## Contribute

Hell yeah! just make PRs I will review them, or if you have more of a clue on writing than I do, I can make you a reviewer.

## Thanks

Special thanks to my early-stage investors and friends: Chon, Shankar, Patrik, Chetan, and Navin. To my family, for always being there. To the team at MindsDB, and to all the friends who patiently listened to my nonstop rambling about fundraising being “a thing with rules.” A special thank you to Luis Silva for encouraging me to turn my notes into a PDF—and for enduring the pain of actually reading them. And finally, to my co-founder Adam, for joining me on the crazy ride of building a company together.
