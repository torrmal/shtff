A book for people who Googled "how to raise money" at 3 AM and ended up here instead of therapy.

This is a draft of my learnings of the pre-seed stage funding at [mindsdb](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb)

## What Is This?

A survival guide disguised as a founders tutorial to fundraising.

If you've ever:
- Explained your startup to your mom and watched her soul leave her body
- Split equity 50/50 because "the vibes felt right"
- Called a pivot a "strategic evolution" with a straight face
- Mass emailed VCs like you were launching a desperate OnlyFans for term sheets

Welcome home.

## Build the Book

```bash
make book
```

That's it. Your PDF appears like a VC at a YC lunch: `book.pdf`

## Requirements

LaTeX. Install it however you install things. You're a founder; you'll figure it out or mass blame it on your co-founder.

## Who Should Read This?

Founders. Dreamers. People whose therapists have therapists.

Anyone who's ever looked at their bank account, then at their burn rate, and whispered: *"Math is just, like, a vibe."*

## Who Should NOT Read This?

People who use "synergy" unironically. Leave. Now. This book can smell you.

## License

Any modification or publication must credit **Jorge Torres**, because his ego runs on recognition and instant ramen, and both are non-negotiable.

*Now stop reading READMEs and go build something that'll make your future biographer uncomfortable.*
